        <h2 id='t2'>Attending the Conference</h2>
        <h3 id='t20'>Overview</h3>
        <p>This year's conference provides two distinct ways to attend the conference, either through zoom or through live broadcast.
            You can access them both from the <a href="https://icaps21.icaps-conference.org/attending/">ICAPS-21 website</a> and through gather (see below).</p>
      <p>You do not have to commit to one method or the other for the length of the conference: you may choose either one whenever you join.</p>
      <p>The way you interact with the speakers and the other audience members differs depending on which method you choose:</p>
            <ol>
        <li>In Zoom, you can post your questions in the chat or ask these questions in voice during live Q&amp;A.  If you want to ask a question by voice, please use the “Raise Hand” option in the Zoom interface, and wait to be called on by the session chair, who will unmute you.</li>
        <li>For <a href="https://icaps21.icaps-conference.org/live/">live broadcast</a>*, there is a RocketChat window provided on the broadcast page
            for chatting among participants. You can ask question there, but questions regarding the presentation posted on RocketChat might not be answered
          during the presentation or live Q&amp;A.  <!-- If you want to be sure to be able to ask a question, you should attend via Zoom. -- we already say this below. -->
</li>
    </ol>
        <p><b>The participants that expect to ask questions are encouraged to join via Zoom, while others are encouraged to watch the live broadcast. In any case, please use only one of these two options at a time.</b></p>

<!--            Through zoom you will be directly joining the sessions without needing to navigate through the virtual space, but many of the social programs will be held on the gather platform.-->
<!--            On the other hand, through gather you can move to the specific venue location in the interface and go to the streaming page (details are provided below).</p>-->
<!--        <p>-->
<!--            The way you will participate in a session depends on whether you attend it through Zoom or through streaming (reached through Gather).  If you participate through Zoom, you will be able to ask questions with voice and audio. If you participate in a session through streaming, you will only be able to ask questions by typing them into the embedded RocketChat text window.-->
<!--&lt;!&ndash;            Though in this option, you will have to ask all questions via rocketchat and if you need to ask any questions in person (via video), you will have to join the zoom call.&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--        </p>-->
<!--        <h3 id='t21'>How to attend Doctoral Consortium?</h3>-->
<!--        <p>-->
<!--            This year Doctoral Consortium (DC) will be held in Zoom. <br>-->
<!--            After you login on our ICAPS-21 website, you can join DC by clicking the DC button in the table below:-->
<!--        </p>-->
<!--        <img class='ps' src="/assets/images/help/profile-schedule.png"/>-->
<!--        -->
<!--        -->
<!--        <h3 id='t22'>How to attend Tutorials/Workshops?</h3>-->
<!--        <p>-->
<!--            There are two options for you to attend tutorials and workshops:<br>-->
<!--            1.   Similar to DC, you could attend Tutorials and Workshops by clicking the corresponding button (Tu+1 (<a href="https://icaps21.icaps-conference.org/Schedule/tutorial_template.html?tutNum=Tutorial1"> Hands-on Introduction to dcss-ai-wrapper</a>), Tu+2 (<a href="https://icaps21.icaps-conference.org/Schedule/tutorial_template.html?tutNum=Tutorial2">Trustworthy AI</a>) or workshop names) in the above table.<br>-->
<!--            2.   You can also go to Gather  (by simply clicking the <button style="background-color: rgb(122, 128, 230);border-radius: 4px;color: white;" onclick="window.open('https\:\/\/gather.town/app/V6z77iZjpGdUzBPo/ICAPS21')">Go to Gather</button> button as shown right above the table) where you can see the tutorial and/or workshop rooms and attend tutorials and workshops by pressing "x" when you are in the corresponding rooms. We strongly suggest you attending tutorials and workshops via our Gather platform such that you could meet and talk to other participants in Gather.<br>-->
<!--            Tutorials and workshops will be held in the "Tutorial/Workshop" building. More details please refer to the following section about Guide for Gather.-->

        <h3 id='t23'>Guide for virtual conference</h3>
        <p>
            If it is the first time for you to enter our gather space, you will be required to input your name and choose an avatar and clothing for that avatar. 
            After that, you will be prompted to set up your camera, audio and microphone (if you prefer not to use them, you can just ignore this). 
            Then you can enter our ICAPS-21 space by clicking "Join the Gathering".<br>
            When you are in Gather, if you are unable to move because other participants are in the way, please move while holding down 'g' in your keyboard.  
            This will put you into <a href="https://support.gather.town/help/gather-102#ghost-mode">"ghost mode"</a> and you will be able to move through other participants.
        </p>
        <h3 id='t230'>Attending the main conference via Gather</h3>
        <p>
            From Gather.Town, go into the session room and click x to open a window with the attending options and links.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you are done for the day, you can simply close the window or tab with your Gather session: Gather will use cookies to remember your avatar configuration and position in the space, as long as you return from the same browser.
            For more information, see <a href="https://support.gather.town/help">Gather.Town's online help</a>.

                <li>                In case 2, the poster session will be held in the form of group discussion.  A workshop room includes four private areas where authors can share their screen to participants in the same areas.

        <!-- <h3 id='t24'>Virtual conference center basics:</h3>
        <p>
            The layout and usage is fairly obvious. Just <a href="https://gather.town/Z1SdmgDu1rDoaMlD/ICAPS2020" target="_blank">go there</a>  and have a look around. We hope you like it!<br>
            You can choose your avatar character and appearance from a limited set of options. <br>
            The only attribute by which people will actually be able to "recognize" you is your name tag.<br>
            "Local" chat in Gather is visible only to people in your interaction distance (the people you can currently talk to); "global" chat is visible everywhere.<br>
            The session rooms in Gather contain an internet link leading to the online meeting (e.g. zoom). You follow that link, leaving Gather temporarily, by pressing `x'. There also is a variety of other internet links in our center: sponsor web pages (Main Area); shared whiteboard tables in the workshop rooms; feedback to the organizers (Main Area); bar jokes (guess what, in the Bar).
        </p>

        <h3 id='t25'>Private spaces and spotlighted positions:</h3>
        <p>
            The map contains a variety of so-called "private spaces". People within such a space all see and hear each other; nobody outside the space does. Rectangular marked areas (mostly around posters) identify such private spaces. At tables with chairs (mostly Bar and Place Stanislas), the private space contains exactly the people sitting on the chairs. (Note: you cannot sit "on top of each other"; these tables are for small meetings just like at a real conference.)
            Some rooms contain spotlighted positions. If you stand in such a position, your audio goes to all people present in the room. This feature is included in the DC/Diversity Event room (announcements), workshop and tutorial rooms (announcements, explanations), and in the Bar (feeling expansive? wanna sing a song?).
        </p>

        <h3 id='t26'>Locating people:</h3>
        <p>To find somebody in the virtual conference center you can search for her/him in the participants tab. If she/he is online, you can click her/his name and then the locate button. This function will show you a path on the map to the person you are looking for.</p>
        
        <h3 id='t27'>What if the quality of videos streamed in zoom is bad at my end?</h3>
        <p>
            All main-conference videos are available on this web page. You can choose to play the video on your own computer, in parallel to the zoom meeting. <br>
            To navigate to the video, simply open the session in the <a href="https://icaps20.icaps-conference.org/schedule.html" target="_blank">Schedule</a> and click on the paper. <br><br>
            We chose to stream videos into zoom in order to make sessions as "Live" as possible, with everything happening in a single platform. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.
        </p>
        <h2 id='t3'>Technicalities</h2>

        <h3 id='t31'>What tools and logins do I need?</h3>
        <p>
            The conference takes place in our virtual conference center, on the <a href="https://gather.town/" target="_blank">Gather</a> platform. <br>
            Please use your REAL and FULL name in Gather, as this is how other participants will identify you (it will be the "name tag" of your virtual character). The password for the virtual conference center is given in the e-mail confirming your registration. That same password also is used to access the main-conference paper sessions. <br>
            All main-conference sessions will be done in <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank">Zoom</a>. Please use your REAL and FULL name in Zoom. The videos will be streamed into the Zoom meeting by a host. Session chairs will decide when to start the next talk video. Paper discussion will be in live audio/video, plus textual chat while the videos are streaming.
        </p>
        <h3 id='t32'>What are the systems requirements?</h3>
        <p>
            The virtual conference center runs on <a href="https://gather.town/" target="_blank">Gather</a>. Gather runs in the browser, and can in principle be used on any computer (laptop, desktop) on any OS (Windows, Mac OS, Linux). Currently only Google Chrome and Firefox are supported though. We recommend to use Chrome, which tends to give best results. <br>
            All main-conference sessions will be done in <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank">Zoom</a>. You can use Zoom via their web client (Google Chrome, Firefox and Chromium Edge), but only with restricted functionality. We recommend to install and use the Zoom app.
        </p>
        <h3 id='t33'>Can I join the main-conference zoom sessions by telephone instead?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes you can. Dial into zoom as usual, finding your local number<a href="https://www.icaps-conference.org/icaps-code-of-conduct/" target="_blank">here</a>. The Meeting ID is 945 8473 0447. The Passcode is given in the e-mail confirming your registration.
        </p>
        <h2 id='t4'>Accessibility and Safety</h2>
        <h3 id='t41'>How do you ensure safe online engagement?</h3>
        <p>
            All participants are bound and expected to uphold the conference’s Code of Conduct, which can be found here. We guard against "Zoom Bombing" by requiring a password, and having moderators with the ability to evict participants.
        </p>

        <h3 id='t42'>How do I report disrespectful engagement, trolling, or other breaches of the code of conduct?</h3>
        <p>
            Please contact the ICAPS advocates <a href="mailto:onaindia@dsic.upv.es" target="_blank">Eva Onaindia</a> and <a href="https://www.icaps-conference.org/icaps-code-of-conduct/" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h3 id='t43'>General data protection</h3>
        <p>
            This site records a very limited amount of data. Zoom sessions will not be recorded. The material you submit (slides, posters and videos), will be made publicly available on the ICAPS Web pages.
        </p>

        <h2 id='t5'>For Authors</h2>
        <h3 id='t51'>How do I submit my material?</h3>
        <p>
            Main-conference authors will upload their material (talk video, poster PDF, optionally slides) to a cloud folder via a link. The link for each submission is sent to the authors individually, along with detailed instructions. <span style="font-weight: bolder;">The deadline for material upload is October 16. </span><br>
            If you are a main-conference author and have not received a mail with further instruction until October 6, please contact:<a href="mailto:icapsgz2021@gmail.com">icapsGZ2021@gmail.com</a>
        </p>

        <h3 id='t52'>What do I need to know to present my poster?</h3>
        <p>
            Each paper will also get a poster. There will be a poster session on the last day of the conference. To take part in the poster session you have to upload your poster until October 16 (see also the preceding question). <br>
            Format The poster must be a PDF in portrait format (this constraint is imposed by gather.town). <br>
            Presentation At least one author should be at the poster stand during the whole poster session. The marked area around each poster is a "private space", meaning that the poster conversation includes all, and only, the people in that space. Also, the people in the marked area see the poster in full screen. 
        </p>
        <h3 id='t53'>Recommendations for recording your talk:</h3>
        <p>
            Your talk video should be 10min long. Please make sure that the video has at least HD (720p) quality and a decent sound quality by using an external microphone to reduce fan noise. The video should be in a format compatible with <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/4603579" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. A free recording program for Windows, Mac and Linux is <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank">OBS Studio</a>. This allows in particular to include the presenter in a corner of the video (if you so wish, see next).
            Word of caution: The talk videos will be streamed into zoom (by the conference team). While we will do so from powerful machines with good internet connection, video quality may still be bad for highly dynamic data-intensive parts of the video, in particular a) the presenter face, b) embedded videos, and c) fancy animations. The choice is yours. We disadvise the use of b) and c).
        </p>
        <h3 id='t54'>How do I present my paper?</h3>
        <p>
            You, or at least one of your co-authors, should be present in each of the two occurrences of your paper's session. Your job is to 1) answer questions in the chat while the video is being streamed, and 2) answer questions in the subsequent live audio/video discussion just like at a physical conference.
            Your paper talk video will be streamed into the zoom meeting by the conference team, so you do not need to worry about that. Your job is to produce the video and to answer questions.
