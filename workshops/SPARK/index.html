                    This workshop series aims to provide a stable forum on
                    relevant topics connected to application-focused research
                    and the deployment of P&amp;S systems. The immediate legacy
                    began in 2007 with the ICAPS'07 Workshop on `Moving Planning
                    and Scheduling Systems into the Real World’, and continued
                    in 2008-2020 with successful yearly editions. 2021 is the
                    14th edition of SPARK.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The websites of the previous editions of the workshop series
                    are available at
                    <a href="http://decsai.ugr.es/~lcv/SPARK/"
                      >http://decsai.ugr.es/~lcv/SPARK/</a
                    >. These workshops presented a stimulating environment where
                    researchers could discuss the opportunity and challenges in
                    moving P&amp;S developments into practice, and analyze
                    domains and problem instances under study for, or closely
                    inspired by, real industrial/commercial deployment of
                    P&amp;S techniques.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The challenges and discussions that emerged in the last
                    years' editions set the baseline for this year's SPARK
                    workshop. A goal of the workshop series is the definition of
                    a longer term set of challenges that could be of benefit for
                    the research community as well as practitioners. SPARK is
                    the ideal incubator to test, discuss, mature and improve
                    potential papers for that main track with the feedback of an
                    excellent audience, and a great place for the inception of
                    new applications and challenges.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to share their
                    domains and instances, or parts of them, towards a library
                    of practical benchmarking problems that could also be useful
                    for the community.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Accepted papers will be presented in plenary or poster
                    sessions during the workshop. Each presented paper will
                    receive comments from a designated moderator, in order to
                    start the discussion at the workshop.
                  </p>

                    Starting from the results of the previous editions, SPARK'21
                    will deepen the debate on application-relevant aspects of
                    P&amp;S theory and practice, with the aim of reporting and
                    discussing experiences relating to deploying P&amp;S
                    systems.

                  <h3>Diversity</h3>
                  <p>
                    The SPARK workshop has a positive history of diversity
                    within the organising committee, programme committee and
                    attendees, including individuals of different gender, race,
                    nationality, and at different stages in their career.
                    However, to ensure SPARK remains and progresses to being
                    more diverse, part of the organiser's responsibility this
                    year will be to ensure that SPARK has:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A programme committee that has true diversity, consisting
                      of an equal split of gender and inclusion of
                      under-represented gender identifications, where possible
                      and without positive discrimination. A maximum of three
                      reviewers from any country. This will be done based on the
                      country of their main residing organisation. Of the three,
                      there must only be one member for the career stages of:
                      Early, Established, Leading.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Papers are reviewed double-blind in an attempt to ensure
                      all submitted papers are fairly reviewed and unconscious
                      bias is minimised.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Presentations by accepted papers will be prioritised and
                      balanced throughout the sessions to ensure diversity is
                      throughout SPARK sessions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Diversity information will be collected on submitted
                      papers, accepted papers, programme committee, and
                      attendees. We will ensure consent is granted before
                      information is collected and anonymised. We plan to
                      publish abstract statistics as part of the SPARK
                      proceedings to ensure transparency and as comparative
                      future measure.
