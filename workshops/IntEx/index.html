                  <p>
                    Automated planners are increasingly being integrated into
                    online acting systems. The integration may, for example,
                    embed a domain-independent temporal planner in a
                    manufacturing system (e.g., the Xerox printer application)
                    or autonomous vehicles (e.g., a planetary rover or an
                    underwater glider). The integration may resemble something
                    more like an "acting and planning stack" where an automated
                    planner produces an activity or task plan that is further
                    refined by an actor before being executed by the execution
                    platform of the actor, such as, a reactive controller (e.g.,
                    robotics). Or, the integration may be a domain-specific
                    policy that maps states to actions (e.g., reinforcement
                    learning). Models for planning and execution can be same or
                    different; the planning model can define context-dependent
                    actions schema for online (re-)planning or can just specify
                    flexibility to be handled separately at execution time.
                    Online learning may or may not be involved, and may include
                    adjusting or augmenting the model, determining when to
                    repair versus replan, learning to switch policies, etc. A
                    specific focus of these integrations involves online
                    deliberation and managing the execution of actions, bringing
                    to the foreground concerns over how much computational
                    effort planning should invest over time.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In any of these systems, a planner generates action
                    sequences that are eventually dispatched to an executive,
                    yet taking action in a dynamic world rarely proceeds
                    according to plan. When planning assumptions are challenged
                    during execution, or some dynamic events occur, it raises a
                    number of interesting questions about how the system should
                    respond and which is the scope of online deliberation versus
                    execution. Is the "acting" side of the system responsible
                    for a response or the "planning" side? Or do the two need to
                    cooperate and how much? When should the activity planner
                    abandon or preempt the current goals? Should the task
                    planner repair a plan or replan from scratch? Should the
                    executive adjust its current policy, switch to a new one, or
                    learn a new policy from more relevant experience?
                  </p>

                    The fifth edition of the workshop on Integrated Planning,
                    Acting, and Execution (IntEx) aims: (1) to provide a forum
                    for discussing the challenges of integrating online
                    planning, acting, and execution, and (2) to assess the
                    potential for holding an integrated execution competitions
                    at ICAPS. Invited topics include:

                  <p>
                    We plan a one-day workshop with a focus on discussion. In
                    contrast to the invited speaker form, we plan to host
                    “opposing views” debates, where two members of the community
                    will be encouraged to debate a topic relevant to the
                    workshop in as creative a way as possible. Small-group
                    breakouts after the debates will address questions raised by
                    the debate so all participants gain from the experience.
                  </p>
