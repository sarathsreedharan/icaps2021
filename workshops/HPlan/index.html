                  Fourth ICAPS Workshop on Hierarchical Planning (HPlan)
                </h1>

              <div class="row">
                <ul>
                  <p>
                    The motivation for using hierarchical planning formalisms is
                    manifold. It ranges from an explicit and predefined guidance
                    of the plan generation process and the ability to represent
                    complex problem solving and behavior patterns to the option
                    of having different abstraction layers when communicating
                    with a human user or when planning co-operatively. The
                    best-known formalism in the field is Hierarchical Task
                    Network (HTN) planning. In addition, there are several other
                    hierarchical planning formalisms, e.g., hybrid planning
                    (incorporating aspects from POCL planning), Hierarchical
                    Goal Network (HGN) planning (incorporating a hierarchy on
                    goals), or formalisms that combine task hierarchies with
                    timeline planning (e.g. ANML). Hierarchies induce
                    fundamental differences from classical planning, creating
                    distinct computational properties and requiring separate
                    algorithms from non-hierarchical planners. Many of these
                    aspects of hierarchical planning are still unexplored. Thus,
                    we encourage any contribution, independent of the underlying
                    hierarchical planning formalism, and want to provide a forum
                    for researchers to discuss the various aspects of
                    hierarchical planning.

                  <h3 class="mt-4">Attending HPlan</h3>
                  
                  Like ICAPS (and just like in 2020), HPlan will be carried out via gather.town. This year, attendance isn't free. To <a href="https://icaps21.icaps-conference.org/registration/">register for the entire ICAPS conference</a> (including all workshops), it's 50 USD for non-students and 20 USD for students.<br><br>
                  
                  The first parts (invited talk and teaser talks) will be via zoom, the poster sessions will be carried out via gather.town. See our schedule below for more details. The zoom link is provided within our workshop room (behind door 1), you obtain it by pressing 'x'. <br><br>
                  
                  <h4>Some further useful information on attendance and gather.town:</h4>

                  <ul>
                    <li>How to log in? 
                       <ul>
                        <li>First, <a href="https://icaps21.icaps-conference.org/login/">log into the ICAPS website</a></li>
                        <li>Now you should see a button "Attending" on the top-right next to your name, which was previously the login button</li>
                        <li>Clicking it will reveal a large "Go to Gather -->" button. Click it! :)</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Please use your full name for your Avatar.</li>
                    <li>Please use the button "g" while walking to enable the <i>ghost mode</i>, thus preventing you from opening audio and video connections while just walking by other people. That way you can also walk through others, which is practical in crowded spaces.</li>
                    <li>You will be able to find the posters from the names of the respective papers.</li>
                    <li>If you meet other people in a private area, note that under the line of videos in gather.town there is a double-arrow pointing to the bottom. If you hit it you see all group members like you would in Zoom.</li>
                    <li>As said above, in order to join a zoom session, you have to hit "x" within our HPlan workshop room, thus temporarily leaving gather.town and running zoom.</li>
                    <li>Note that the people presenting a poster might also want to attend a poster, so it could be that some poster is temporarily unattended for some some short while — just like in real life!</li>
                    <li>Need further help?

                  <h3 class="mt-4">Submission Details</h3>

                  <p>
                    The formatting guidelines (author kit, etc.) are the same as
                    for ICAPS 2021. Like at the main conference, there will be a
                    high quality double-blind review process against the
                    standard ICAPS criteria of significance, soundness,
                    scholarship, clarity, and reproducibility. However,
                    submissions may be less evolved than at the main conference.
                  </p>

                  <p>We have two categories:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Technical research papers (short or long) and</li>
                    <li>Challenge papers (short).</li>
                  </ol>

                  <p>
                    Technical research papers are standard conference papers,
                    but may be less evolved. The purpose of challenge papers is
                    to report on or to make aware of interesting/important
                    problems in Hierarchical Planning and to encourage
                    discussion at the workshop -- not to present some
                    significant contribution.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Authors may submit *long papers* (up to 8 pages plus up to
                    one page of references) or *short papers* (up to 4 pages
                    plus up to one page of references). The purpose of short
                    papers is to encourage publications of more preliminary
                    results; challenge papers need to be short papers. In case
                    of acceptance, the full 5, resp. 9, pages can be used for
                    the paper, e.g. to address the reviewers' comments.
                  </p>

                  <!--<p>We encourage the submission of papers that are, at the time of
submission, currently under review at IJCAI 2021 (or any other conference). In case such a double
submission gets both accepted at IJCAI and at the workshop, the
proceedings will include a link to the paper at the other conference (so
formally it will not be part of the proceedings), but the authors can
still present the paper at the workshop.</p>-->
                  <p>
                    If you are interested in presenting work that was accepted
                    or published at a conference or journal, please contact the
                    organizers. We will not include such a paper into our
                    proceedings, but we are happy to discuss options for
                    presenting such work.
                  </p>

                  Malik Ghallab gives an invited talk about:<br><br>
                                  
                  <h4>Hierarchical Online Reasoning for the Integration of Planning and Acting</h4>
                  
                  <p>Hierarchization in planning has often been viewed mainly as a means for reducing the search complexity, to be paid for with additional domain modeling efforts. HTN planning, for example, has sometime been opposed to generative planning techniques, and referred to as a programming paradigm in planning. We pursue here a quite different motivation for hierarchization than tractable computations in a huge search space. Namely, we are interested in planning for the purpose of acting, and consider hierarchization as a central concept for the integration of reasoning on actions and performing them.<br><br>
                  
                  We have argued in [1] that the design of a cognitive actor has to rely on two interconnected principles: (i) <i>hierarchically organized deliberation</i>, and (ii) <i>continual online planning and reasoning</i>. Many challenging problems for such a design have been underlined in [1], several of which remain pending, while a few have progressed towards acceptable solutions. This talk will report on a line of work that illustrates such a progress.<sup>1</sup> Initiated in [2, Chap. 3], the work was pursued through several algorithmic developments and trials, e.g., in [3, 5, 6]; it reached a comprehensive stage in [4]. The talk will motivate the integrated planning and acting issues and present three technical components:<br>

                  <ul>
                    <li>A hierarchical task-oriented knowledge representation for expressing <i>operational models</i> of actions (<i>how</i> to do things), which relies on a collection of refinement methods describing alternative ways to handle tasks and react to events. A refinement method can be any complex algorithm, with subtasks to be refined recursively and <i>nondeterministic</i> primitive actions which query and change the world.</li>

                    <li>A Refinement Acting Engine (RAE) which interacts with an execution platform and performs online reasoning for the achievement of tasks and reaction to events by following refinement methods adapted to the current dynamic context, and retrying alternative methods when needed. RAE chooses its refinement methods with the help of a online optimizing planner.</li>

                    <li>A Monte Carlo Tree Search planner, called UPOM, which assesses the utility of possible methods and finds an approximately optimal one for RAE to pursue an ongoing activity. UPOM is a progressive deepening, receding-horizon anytime planner which relies on domain-dependent heuristics, learned from simulations and/or real-world interactions.</li>
                  </ul>

                  A few empirical results will be presented.<sup>2</sup> Extensions of the approach for handling temporal issues as well as space and motion planning issues (to address the well known <i>“Task and Motion Planning”</i> TAMP problems) will be briefly discussed, together with perspectives for learning refinement methods for operational models.
