                    >, this competition aims at unleashing the power of
                    artificial intelligence even further for our real-world
                    industrial application: controlling electricity power
                    transmission in real-time and moving closer to truly “smart”
                    grids using underutilized flexibilities. In 2020,
                    participants were asked to develop an agent to be robust to
                    unexpected events and keep delivering reliable electricity
                    everywhere even in difficult circumstances.

                    <br />
                    In this competition, participants, while dealing with a
                    higher penetration of renewable energy, will be asked in
                    addition to design trustworthy agents that are able to
                    communicate when they are in trouble, especially when they
                    might fail. This will more concretely lead the path towards
                    an AI assistant for human operators, who will still be
                    responsible for managing the grid, rather than a mere
                    blackbox agent. Join us for this Augmented Intelligence

                    In this competition, participants are invited to develop
                    automatic reinforcement learning solutions to the dynamic
                    job shop scheduling problem (DJSSP). The solutions are
                    expected to automatically train promising agents on a
                    distribution of DJSSP tasks. After a feedback phase where
                    solutions can be developed and fine-tuned with daily
                    feedback, those that perform best on a set of five unseen
                    tasks win the competition.

                    factories every year during which a large amount of cargoes
                    need to be delivered among factories. Due to the
                    uncertainties of customers' requirements and production
                    processes, most delivery requirements cannot be fully
                    decided beforehand. The delivery orders, with the
                    information including the pickup factories, delivery
                    factories, the amount of cargoes and the time requirement,
                    occur randomly and a fleet of homogeneous vehicles is
                    periodically scheduled to serve these orders. Due to the
                    large amount of deliver requests, even a small improvement

                    The Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem (DPDP) is an
                    essential problem within the logistics domain. So far,
                    research on this problem has mainly focused on using
                    artificial data which fails to reflect the complexity of
                    real-world problems. With this competition, we hope to
                    promote the research and development of techniques
