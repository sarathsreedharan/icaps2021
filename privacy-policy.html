              personal information.
            </li>

              We may publish or display aggregate data when we find it useful
              (e.g., when collaborating with other conferences, or at an ICAPS
              council or community meeting). In those cases, we will not share
              your personal data directly, but it may be possible to identify
              certain information (e.g., an individual's stated gender or
              dietary preference) about an individual when combined with other
              data (e.g., personal knowledge).

          <p>
            Unless we indicate this to you in this policy or via other direct
            communication, we do not share, sell, rent, or trade your
            information to third parties for their own promotional purposes.
            We will do our best to avoid sharing data unnecessarily and will
            work to only share what is necessary to fulfill our obligations to
            you.

          <p><b>Do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?</b></p>
          <p>
            In short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to
            collect and store your information, particularly during payment
            processes.
          </p>

          <p>
            We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web
            beacons and pixels) to access or store session information.
          </p>

          <p><b>How long do we keep your information?</b></p>
          <p>
            In short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to
            fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless
            otherwise required by law.
          </p>

          <p>
            We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
            necessary to service the ICAPS 2021 attendees and allow us to
            process data for future ICAPS conferences unless a longer
            retention policy is required by law (such as for tax purposes,
            accounting, requirements from funding agencies, or other legal
            requirements). When we have an ongoing legitimate need to process
            your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it.
            If this is not possible (for example, because your personal
            information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
            securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
            further processing until deletion is possible.
          </p>

          <p><b>How do we keep your information safe?</b></p>
          <p>
            In short: We aim to protect your personal information through a
            system of organizational and technical security measures.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have implemented appropriate organizational security measures
            designed to protect the personal information we process. However,
            please remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself
            is 100% secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal
            information, the transmission of personal information to and from
            our sites is at your own risk. You should only access our services
            within a secure environment.
          </p>

          <p><b>Do we collect information from minors?</b></p>
          <p>
            In short: We do not knowingly collect data from children under 18
            years of age.
          </p>

          <p>
            We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under
            18 years of age. By using the site, you represent that you are at
            least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor
            and consent to such minor dependent's use of the site. If we learn
            that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has
            been collected, we will delete that data from our records.

            In short: You may request to review, change, or ask us to delete
            any of your personal data at any time.

          <p>
            If you are a resident of the European Economic Area and you
            believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information,
            you have the right to complain to your local data protection
            supervisory authority. You can find their contact details

            <strong>Controls for do-not-track features.</strong> Most web
            browsers and some mobile systems have Do-Not-Track ("DNT")

          <p>
            We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated
            version will be indicated by the "Revised" date and the updated
