                  <h4>Getting Started</h4>
        
                  <p>A iclr.cc login and an ICLR 2021 registration are required to access the content. Everyone is expected to
                    follow the <a href="/public/CodeOfConduct" target="_blank">Code of Conduct</a>. To jump right into the
                    conference program, we recommend the conference <a href="http://iclr.cc/virtual/2021/calendar">schedule</a>
                    to get started. You can also find more details about the virtual conference format in the <a
                      href="https://iclr.cc/virtual/2021/remarks/4385">opening remarks</a> from the organizing committee. Read
                    on below to learn more about how to use all elements of the virtual conference site.</p>
        
                  <p>If you can not find answers here use the help links at the bottom of the page.</p>
        
                  <p><strong>System Requirements</strong></p>
        
                  <p>JavaScript must be enabled in your browser. A 10 mb of inbound bandwidth is recommended. A Chromium browser
                    is recommended.</p>
        
                  <p><strong>Navigating the Website</strong></p>
        
                  <p>All of ICLR 2021 will be accessed through the main webpage. You may access all parts of the conference
                    using the top menu bar. Check the Schedule to get an overview of when the live sessions for all events are
                    taking place. You may navigate all the papers in the Papers section. You may search for titles and authors
                    or look through all papers by skimming titles and bookmarking them. You can bookmark other sessions as well.
                    If you go to your name in the top right corner and click on My Bookmarks in the dropdown menu, you can
                    Download the schedule with all sessions you bookmarked and you can import it in your calendar. <strong>You
                      can take a break and socialize in the <a
                        href="https://eventhosts.gather.town/app/skRRdnvqA0iH1UXk/iclr-2021-social-15">ICLR cafe</a> any time
                      during the conference.</strong></p>
        
                  <p><strong>ICLR Poster Sessions</strong></p>
        
                  <p>The poster sessions will be held in GatherTown. You can access the poster in GatherTown by clicking "Visit
                    Poster at Spot XX in Virtual World" on the paper's page.</p>
        
                  <p><strong>Sponsors</strong></p>
        
                  <p>We encourage everyone to visit the <a href="/Expo/Conferences/2021/SponsorHall">sponsor hall</a> just like
                    you would at the physical conference<strong>. </strong> The sponsors have job listings, demonstrations, and
                    chats ready for you. </p>
        
                  <p>Some sponsors have a Topia virtual (spatial) world. Topia only supports Chromium browsers. When
                    authenticating choose "Sign in with Email" in red rather than authenticating with Facebook or Google, and
                    use your ICLR.cc email address.</p>
        
                  <p><strong>Rocket.Chat</strong></p>
        
                  <p>All attendees with registration will automatically have access to Rocket.Chat, a separate Rocket.Chat
                    account is not needed. If you have problems with Rocket.Chat try refreshing the page. If that does not work
                    try <a href="/logout">logging out</a> and then logging back in.</p>
        
                  <p>Each session has a Rocket.Chat channel. Questions for the speakers should be posted there. Other
                    participants that are also interested in the question can comment or put emoji on the post to increase its
                    visibility. Eventually, the moderator will select questions to ask the speaker. Speakers will be able to
                    continue answering questions on Rocket.Chat after the end of their talk for approximately one hour.</p>

                    <li><strong>HelpDesk</strong><br>
                      There is a <a href="https://chat.iclr.cc/channel/HelpDesk" target="_blank">#HelpDesk</a> channel in
                      Rocket.Chat where you can post any conference support questions. If you are not able to access
                      Rocket.Chat, send an email to helpdesk@iclr.cc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Full Screen Mode </strong><br>
                      You can run Rocket.Chat in Full Screen Mode which lists all the channels you've visited. To go to
                      Full-Screen Mode click on the <strong>Full [ ]</strong> icon in the top right corner. When prompted select
                      Authenticate with OAuth and then click the blue Authorize button in the Authorize Rocket.Chat window</li>
                    <li><strong>Desktop Client</strong><br>

                      client for your platform <a href="https://rocket.chat/install" target="_blank">here</a>. When you run it
                      enter the server URL: https://chat.iclr.cc. You may be prompted to log into iclr.cc. After you log in,
                      select Authenticate with OAuth and then click the blue Authorize button in the Authorize Rocket.Chat

                  <p><strong>Timezones</strong></p>
        
                  <p>This is a cautionary tale about timezones. Several attendees have noticed that the times shown in the <a
                      href="/virtual/2021/calendar">virtual website</a> appeared incorrect. The problem was that they chose a
                    timezone that did not adjust for daylight savings time. We highly recommend picking a timezome based off a
                    nearby city, especially if your area observes daylight savings time. Timezones are <a
                      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database">political and complex </a>and thus confusing. Please <a
                      href="/set_timezone?nextp=/virtual/2021/index.html">check your timezone</a>, and preferably choose a zone
                    based on a city. Note that we are currently in Daylight Savings Time rather than Standard time in most, but
                    not all of the US and Europe. </p>
        
                  <p>Your current timezone: <a href="/set_timezone?nextp=/virtual/2021/index.html">America/Los_Angeles</a></p>
