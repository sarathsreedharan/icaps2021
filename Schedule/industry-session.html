                    Huawei is a leading global provider of information and
                    communications technology (ICT) infrastructure and smart
                    devices. We need to deliver hundreds of billions of dollar
                    products across four key domains â€“ telecom networks, IT,
                    smart devices, and cloud services to more than 170 countries
                    and regions on time every year. As one of the most complex
                    supply chains in the world, a large number of scenarios rely
                    on more efficient and intelligent scheduling & planning
                    (S&P) algorithms. Besides supply chain, the computer system
                    such as our storage production, circuit design and business
                    solution supported by Huawei cloud also need to solve
                    various S&P problems. Advanced S&P algorithms would greatly
                    improve the efficiency of industrial systems and bring
                    numerous economic values. In this talk, we would like to
                    introduce some representative industrial scenarios we met as
                    well as some of our technical works. It is expected to
                    promote the joint research of academia and industry on
                    advanced S&P techniques for typical practical problems.

                    Planning large-scale experiments for high throughput robotic
                    cloud laboratories presents significant challenges,
                    including choices on what measurements to take, how to
                    allocate laboratory resources, and how to describe
                    experiments to support execution and reproducibility. We
                    describe our work on the DARPA Synergistic Discovery and
                    Design project to formalize and plan high throughput
                    screening experiments in both automated closed-loop and
                    investigator-driven open loop experimental campaigns. We
                    highlight the benefits to scientists gained through removing
                    several human touch-points that lead to metadata errors and
                    the advantages of constraint reasoning to support experiment
                    consistency. We also describe the opportunities and
                    challenges for planning research to address practical
                    concerns in bringing automation to the life sciences.

                    Automated planning is a common problem in business
                    environments and other complex interactions between humans
                    and organizations. However, writing a planning model is a
                    means to an end. The popularity of deep learning cast doubts
                    about using model-based AI as practitioners might not want
                    to write or maintain models. The current academic and
                    industrial discussion focus on whether learning or
                    model-based reasoning is a better path for AI problems like
                    policy generation. In contrast, I will discuss how the act
                    of describing a planning model can be seen as a form of
                    declarative control. I will comment on how simple variations
                    of well-studied models corresponds to such control in
                    business contexts, where policies interact with humans,
                    organization practices, software, and data-driven agents.
                    Focused on AI business-to-business applications, I will
                    comment on challenges and opportunities around such new
                    settings and recent work compatible with this direction.

                    models are ill-equipped to handle. In this talk, we will
                    explore how automated planning techniques can be used in the

                    Decision-making is the key to many real-world applications.
                    Many decision optimization methods, e.g., reinforcement
                    learning, have been developed for better decision making. In
                    decision optimization tasks, we often need to interact with
                    the real world or environment. However, accessing the real
                    world may take risks or cost too much. For example, car
                    accidents for automatic driving and production line
                    adjustment in manufacturing plants for smart manufacturing
                    are too dangerous or costly, and we can hardly afford them,
                    and the subsequent decision making will also be badly
                    affected. In many real-world decision optimization
                    paradigms, we often obtain virtual environments that can
                    mimic the real world by manually building or learning from
                    data to avoid unnecessary risks or costs. We call the
                    resulting research area that targets building virtual
                    environments using experiences(e.g., data, knowledge, Etc.)
                    gathered from real decision environments - Environment
                    Learning. In this talk, we will go through several virtual
                    environment driven decision optimization paradigms and
                    present data-driven environment learning approaches that
                    have shown significant benefits for many real-world
                    applications, e.g., Covid-19 pandemic prevention and

                    Distributed Spacecraft Systems are a type of
                    multi-spacecraft mission architecture that can provide
                    improved resolution, coverage, and availability of existing
                    missions and enable missions that would be previously
                    infeasible using traditional approaches. Autonomy is a
                    critical need for these systems. As these systems begin to
                    scale and have more complicated interactions, their
                    responses to observations or operational demands need to be
                    handled autonomously of the ground. Distributed Spacecraft
                    Autonomy (DSA) is a project developed by the National
                    Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that enables
                    distributed spacecraft systems by developing three
                    capabilities: scalable communication, distributed
                    coordination and planning, and human-swarm interaction. DSA
                    will demonstrate these capabilities in two contexts. The
                    first context is a flight demonstration consisting of a
                    software payload hosted on the Starling-1 small-spacecraft
                    mission. This software payload will use the onboard GPS
                    receiver to perform in-situ, swarm-level reconfiguration in
                    response to observed features in the Topside Ionosphere. The
                    second context is a scalability study, which shows how the
                    technologies developed in the flight demonstration can scale
                    to a large number of spacecraft (100). The scalability
                    demonstration applies the tools developed for the flight
                    mission to a hardware-in-the-loop simulation of the flight
                    software payload.
