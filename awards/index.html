<!--                  <p><b>Abstract:</b> We consider the problem of reaching a propositional goal condition in fully-observable non-deterministic (FOND) planning under a general class of fairness assumptions that are given explicitly. The fairness assumptions are of the form A/B for disjoints sets of actions A and B that say that state trajectories that contain infinite occurrences of an action a from A and finite occurrence of actions from B, must also contain infinite occurrences of a followed by each one of its possible outcomes. The infinite trajectories that violate this condition are deemed as unfair. The solutions of a FOND problem with fairness assumptions of this form are policies for which all the fair trajectories reach a goal state. We show that strong and strong cyclic FOND planning, as well as QNP planning, a planning model introduced recently for generalized planning, are all special cases of FOND planning with fairness assumptions of this form, which we call FOND+ planning, which can also combine the adversarial, fair, and conditionally fair actions underlying these models. FOND+ planning is a special case of LTL planning that combines the syntax and the complexity of FOND planning with some of the versatility of LTL for expressing fairness constraints. A planner for FOND+ planning is implemented by reducing FOND-planning to answer set programs, a convenient and high-level alternative to SAT, using the facilities provided by the Clingo system. The performance of the resulting planner is evaluated in comparison with strong, strong cyclic, and QNP planners in problems where they apply, and with LTL synthesis tools on others.</p>-->
