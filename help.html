                its
                visibility. Eventually, the moderator will select questions to ask the speaker. Speakers will be able to

              <p><strong>Timezones</strong></p>

              <p>This is a cautionary tale about timezones. Several attendees have noticed that the times shown in the
                <a href="/virtual/2021/calendar">virtual website</a> appeared incorrect. The problem was that they chose
                a
                timezone that did not adjust for daylight savings time. We highly recommend picking a timezome based off
                a
                nearby city, especially if your area observes daylight savings time. Timezones are <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database">political and complex </a>and thus confusing. Please
                <a href="/set_timezone?nextp=/virtual/2021/index.html">check your timezone</a>, and preferably choose a
                zone
                based on a city. Note that we are currently in Daylight Savings Time rather than Standard time in most,
                but
                not all of the US and Europe. </p>

              <p>Your current timezone: <a href="/set_timezone?nextp=/virtual/2021/index.html">America/Los_Angeles</a>
              </p>
